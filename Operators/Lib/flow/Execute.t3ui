  "Description": "Performs a sequence of drawing operations and then restores the graphics context. You can use it for grouping or activating and deactivating parts of your graphs.\n\nSince [Execute] itself does nothing, you can also use it to name things by inserting it into the graph and setting the instance name by pressing Enter.\n\nAn alternative to [Execute] is [Group], which can also have a translation and multiple input connections.\n",
