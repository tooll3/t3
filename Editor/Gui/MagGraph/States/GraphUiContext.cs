/// <summary>
/// Holds the current interaction state of the graph. It is passed as a parameter

///</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Overall concept of the graph UI system.
///
/// Preface: The node graph is a central piece of Tooll's user interface and probably
/// one of the most complex: For the implementation, we tried to balance the following:
/// - Code should be well-structured and readable.
/// - There should be no mud-ball side effects that lead to inconsistent states and hard-to-reproduce issues.
/// - All interactions should support combined undo/redo out of the box.
/// - The system should be open to implement new features, tweak the design, or adjust behaviors.
/// - Ideally, rendering should be fast.
/// - Cycle checks should be consistent and bulletproof.
/// - Allocations should be avoided if possible.
///
/// The basic components are:
/// - <see cref="Layout"/> holds an intermediate view model that is updated if required. This view model
/// builds referenceable items, view elements, and connections. This makes it much easier to traverse the
/// graph without dictionary lookups. The layout also precomputes the visibility of input links, which simplifies
/// the layout and rendering of connection lines (one of the most complicated parts of the legacy layout).
/// - <see cref="GraphUiContext"/> holds the current interaction state of the graph. It is passed as a parameter
/// during most processing and makes "graph-global" components and states accessible to all related components.
/// New instances of the context are created when the composition object or window changes.
/// - <see cref="StateMachine"/> the state machine is a very bare-bones (no hierarchy or events) implementation
/// of a state machine that handles activation of <see cref="State"/>s. There can only be one state active.
/// Most of the update interaction is done in State.Update() overrides.
/// - <see cref="MagGraphCanvas"/> is a scalable canvas that handles drawing. The Layout sometimes resets
/// the current state.
/// - <see cref="PlaceholderCreation"/> combines drawing and logic that handles creating new operators (it's the
/// "new" SymbolBrowser).
/// - <see cref="ItemMovement"/> handles dragging, snapping, inserting, and unsnapping operators on the canvas.
/// Grouping is handled on the fly by flood-filling "Snapped" Layout-Connections into HashSets.
///
/// Notes:
/// -------
/// Currently, a Context only holds information on a single composition and is discorded as soon as
/// the user navigations to another composition-op (e.g. jumping up, down the composition stack.
///
/// Architectural questions:
/// ------------------------
/// We need to clarify how to deal with modal dialogs like "Edit Comment"
///
///
